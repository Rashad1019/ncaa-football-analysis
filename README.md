# 🏈 NCAA Football Analysis (2013–2023)

This project explores NCAA Division I FBS football team performance over 11 seasons (2013–2023) using publicly available NCAA data. The goal is to uncover which team-level metrics — such as third-down conversion rate, red-zone efficiency, turnover margin, and offensive/defensive balance — are most predictive of success.

The analysis focuses on identifying strategic trends in team performance, understanding the impact of efficiency vs. specialization, and providing actionable insights for data-driven decision-making in college football.

This repository contains the original version of the project, focused on football-specific insights, data storytelling, and visual summaries. For a portfolio-ready version following the full Google Data Analytics Capstone structure, see the enhanced report linked below.
